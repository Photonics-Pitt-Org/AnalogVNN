# Installing AnalogVNN

This page describes how to install AnalogVNN.

### Installation

Install AnalogVNN (one fo the following ways):
- Pip installation instructions:
  - Install [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)
  - Install AnalogVNN using [pip](https://pypi.org/project/analogvnn/)
    ```bash
      pip install analogvnn
    ```
- AnalogVNN can be downloaded at ([GitHub](https://github.com/Photonics-Pitt-Org/AnalogVNN)) or creating a
fork of it.

Install the required dependencies:
- PyTorch
- dataclasses
- scipy
- numpy
- networkx
- tensorboard (optional)
- graphviz (optional)
- python-graphviz (optional)

### Finish

That's it, you are all set to simulate analog neural networks. 
Head over to the {doc}`tutorial` and look over the {doc}`sample_code`.
