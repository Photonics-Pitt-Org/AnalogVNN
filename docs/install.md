# Installing AnalogVNN

This page describes how to install AnalogVNN.

### Installation

Install AnalogVNN (one fo the following ways):

- Pip installation instructions:
  - Install [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)
  - Install AnalogVNN using [pip](https://pypi.org/project/analogvnn/)
    ```bash
      pip install analogvnn
    ```
- AnalogVNN can be downloaded at ([GitHub](https://github.com/Photonics-Pitt-Org/AnalogVNN)) or creating a
  fork of it.

## Dependencies

Install the required dependencies:

- PyTorch
- dataclasses
- scipy
- numpy
- networkx
